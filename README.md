- Hi, Iâ€™m @RonHeg
- I am a retired Electronic Engineer interested in creating random products.
- I am creating a series of shields for use with Arduinos that will hopefully help with the development of projects.
- I can be reached at rjheglertech@gmail.com if you have any questions about the projects I am posting.
